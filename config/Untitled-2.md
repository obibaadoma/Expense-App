 # Expense-Db: PostgreSQL Database Configuration for Rails Application

## Introduction

This repository contains the database configuration for a Rails application named "Expense-Db". The configuration is written in YAML format and is located in the `config/database.yml` file. This document provides a detailed explanation of the configuration, including step-by-step instructions for setting up the database connection.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- PostgreSQL version 9.3 or higher
- Ruby on Rails
- The `pg` gem

### Installing the `pg` Gem

To install the `pg` gem, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gem install pg
```

On macOS with Homebrew, use the following command:

```bash
gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
```

On Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download the win32 build of the `pg` gem from the RubyGems website.
2. Install PostgreSQL and add its `/bin` directory to your system path.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gem install pg
```

## Configuring the Database

The `config/database.yml` file contains the database configuration for your Rails application. It defines the connection parameters for the development, test, and production environments.

### Development Environment

The development environment configuration is as follows:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  database: Expense-Db
  username: admin
  password: admin
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
```

This configuration specifies the following details:

- The database name is `Expense-Db`.
- The username is `admin`.
- The password is `admin`.
- The host is `localhost`.
- The port is `5432`.

### Test Environment

The test environment configuration is as follows:

```yaml
test:
  <<: *default
  database: Expense-Db
```

This configuration inherits the default settings from the development environment and specifies the database name as `Expense-Db`.

### Production Environment

The production environment configuration is as follows:

```yaml
production:
  <<: *default
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
  database: expense_app_production
